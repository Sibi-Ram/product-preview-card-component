- Flexbox

### What I learned

Initailly in css I used
```css
display: flex;
align-items: center;
```
on the ```<main>``` element, but the box was not vertically centered.

After googling I found out the reason.
The reason: I did not set a height on the flex parent (main), so there was no extra vertical space for centering. ___By default, block elements stretch to 100% width but only as much height as their content.___

corrected code:

Set a height (e.g., height: 100vh;) on the flex parent (```<main>```).

```css
height: 100vh;
align-items: center;
```
will vertically center the child inside the parent.

**Key Learning:**

___For vertical centering with flexbox, the container must have a defined height.___
